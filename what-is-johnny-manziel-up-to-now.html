And while he has continued playing football, during a February 2021&nbsp;<a href=#>episode</a> of the "Green Light" podcast, Manziel revealed he was trying to play professional golf —&nbsp;and that he would give himself 12 years to accomplish that goal. "I'm gonna grind this out and see how good I can get and see if I can enter some tournaments and see if I can go play professional golf eventually. I think it is a very uphill battle, but that's what I'm setting for my goals," he explained.</p><p>In July 2021, he got the opportunity to flex his skills during the 51st Higginbotham Texas State Open at The Cascade, but instead was faced with a rude awakening after an underwhelming performance. According to the <a href=#>Golf Channel</a>, Manziel came in last.&nbsp;Despite the outcome, Manziel felt good about being back in his hometown doing what he loves. Though he didn't "play the way I wanted to," he acknowledged, "It's a good first experience for me and had to start somewhere," he told <a href=#>Tyler Morning Telegraph</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcGxkbYN3e9ahmK1lmah6q7vHp6WyZZ2Wu7u1xKVkrqhdqbxuus6wZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
