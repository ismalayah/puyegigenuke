Her primary focus is on modeling and makeup, two areas she’s been carefully perfecting over years of work, but she’s dipped her toes into several other fields over the years. These days, her name is nearly as recognizable as those of the Kardashians, but a number of people don’t actually know what Chyna does. They’ve seen her name on the news and in magazines, but the skills that propelled her to fame remain a mystery.</p><p data-characters=627 data-current-count=627 data-injectable=true>That’s due, in large part, to the multifaceted origins behind Angela Renée White, the woman behind the Blac Chyna moniker. Known primarily as a model and socialite, Chyna has also tried her hand at professional makeup and music, and these days has several success stories to hang her hat on. Her work in modeling, in particular, has served the former stripper well, allowing her to accumulate a solid amount of wealth. She’s turned the money her modeling and work in reality television have earned her into a lucrative career in makeup and education, and seems poised to build upon her current affluence even more.</p><h2 id=h-blac-chyna-s-net-worth data-injectable=false>Blac Chyna’s net worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Blac_Chyna-1.jpg><p data-characters=475 data-current-count=775 data-injectable=true>Blac Chyna <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">got her start</a> as a young stripper in Miami. Her work at a popular downtown Miami club gave Chyna the name recognition she needed to slowly edge her way into fame, and eventually launched her into the modeling world. As cover shoots started piling up, Chyna suddenly found herself fielding offers. Around 2010, she was appearing in a range of magazines and even found work as Nicki Minaj’s stunt double in Kanye West’s “Monster” music video.</p><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=true>After several years of rubbing elbows with major stars, Chyna transformed into a celebrity in her own right. She put the money she earned through modeling into her own boutique in 2013, launching 88fin with fresh clothing and Chyna-approved products. This success soon allowed the former model to launch her own brand of lashes, “Lashed by Blac Chyna,” and her own beauty bar, which she opened in Los Angeles in 2014.</p><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>These days, Chyna is balancing her lash line, beauty bar, and boutique alongside frequent appearances in reality television. She was a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mainstay among the Kardashians</a> for several years, first as a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">foe to Kylie Jenner</a> and later as Rob Kardashian’s girlfriend. The two even welcomed a child into the world before they split, but these days Chyna has distanced herself from the famous family, instead turning her focus to her own fame and fortune.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>Her work has paid off in the form of a solid net worth. The 35-year-old is currently worth around $5 million all on her own, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. She’s accumulated this wealth through her varied business and entertainment pursuits, as well as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">work on OnlyFans</a>.</p><p data-characters=898 data-current-count=1178 data-injectable=true>Chyna’s income has grown markedly over the years, with the last few in particular seeing an uptick in her earnings. Even before she was raking in the big bucks, however, she was pulling in millions per year. She earned around $2 million per year in 2018, 2019, and 2020, according to Celebrity Net Worth. These days, without a link to the Kardashians or her own reality program, some might assume she’s earning less, but they’d be wrong. It seems that, with her OnlyFans page thriving, Chyna might actually be making more in 2023 than she ever has before. Some reports claim she makes as much as $20 million a month from her dedicated page, which would give that net worth a <strong>major</strong> boost. As of now, she’s still only credited with $5 million, but — if any of these OnlyFans rumors are to be believed — Chyna might actually be one of the highest-paid celebs on the planet.</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>Even if she really is only worth $5 million, however, that net worth will carry her far. She’s already reinvested it via her boutique and beauty bar, and the future is likely to hold plenty more opportunity for the popular model.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZKhrqR5wqGwp5mjYrumwIywpqusmGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
