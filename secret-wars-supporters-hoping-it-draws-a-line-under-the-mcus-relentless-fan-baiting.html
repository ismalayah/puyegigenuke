In the last 15 years, though, Marvel Studios has gone beyond that though, managing to appeal to a much broader audience by bringing its characters up to date and creating some of the most widely-loved films of all-time.</p><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=755 data-injectable=true>That being said, as the MCU is in its teenage years, much like teenagers with their fashion trends, it can’t help but look back to the past for inspiration. In the hugely successful Spider-Man: No Way Home we saw the return of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield as their respective Spider-Men characters as well as some of the villains from their movies.</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>Fans were absolutely thrilled to see the actors return to the roles and videos quickly spread of audiences giving a standing ovation upon their reveals. When it was announced that Hugh Jackman would once again be donning the claws, despite saying he was done with the role, the internet had an absolute field day, with every social media site simply abuzz with the news.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=718 data-injectable=true>One fan wonders long can Marvel keep this up before fans eventually get fed up with things from the past being constantly used to capture our attention. How long will pandering to our desire for nostalgia work? They believe that Avengers: Secret Wars could mark a point for the studio to cease looking into the past to inspire us to buy a ticket.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Secret Wars should mark the end of the cameos and nostalgia thing</a> from <a href=#>marvelstudios</a></figure><p data-characters=31 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>Some agreed with the statement.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=631 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>FewWatermelonlesson0’s comment from discussion "Secret Wars should mark the end of the cameos and nostalgia thing"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=112 data-current-count=112 data-injectable=false>Another fan felt that, though it may stop for a while, we could be getting some much much further down the line.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>tangoliber’s comment from discussion "Secret Wars should mark the end of the cameos and nostalgia thing"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=108 data-current-count=108 data-injectable=false>This fan makes the point that once the saga is over, the multiversal aspect will likely come to an end too.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>LittleYellowFish1’s comment from discussion "Secret Wars should mark the end of the cameos and nostalgia thing"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=54 data-current-count=54 data-injectable=false>Others felt like the OP is looking too deeply into it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>ChuckyD2six’s comment from discussion "Secret Wars should mark the end of the cameos and nostalgia thing"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=123 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=true>Yes some films have had cameos and returning characters, but there have been plenty of new character introductions as well.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>68ideal’s comment from discussion "Secret Wars should mark the end of the cameos and nostalgia thing"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=118 data-current-count=418 data-injectable=true>Another pointed out to the fact that we are in the Multiverse Saga, so you should expect some multiversal shenanigans.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>sessho25’s comment from discussion "Secret Wars should mark the end of the cameos and nostalgia thing"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=525 data-injectable=false>It isn’t known yet what is going to come after the Multiverse Saga, whether the final film will somehow put an end to this dimension-hopping, or whether the door will remain open to allow old actors a chance to return.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqp6boprBbsPAq6pmq6WlvbC%2B056prGWYpL2qusZmoK1llKeuuL%2BMmmSloZ6aera6w56pZqyYmnqur9SsZKudnJq7tbjErKpmnpGjeqOtyK2gp59f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
