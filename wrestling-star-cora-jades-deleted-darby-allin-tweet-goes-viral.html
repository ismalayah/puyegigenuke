In June of 2020, during the #SpeakingOut movement, a Twitter user named <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hawlee Cromwell</a> said she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was abused</a> by an unnamed person who would “treat me like his punching bag.”</p><p>He also would threaten to leave me if I didn’t have sex with him or do sexual things and perform sex acts with him. I took me a long time to realize that threatening someone to have sex with you isn’t consent. It’s rape. I struggle with this to this day and have so many fears around sex and around intimacy.</p><p data-characters=65 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false>In August of that year, Cromwell named Darby Allin as her abuser.</p><p>“I’m tired I’m so fucking tired and I don’t care anymore. Darby allin abused me. He abused me and I’m tired of being called a liar by “fans” who have no idea the shitty person he really is. Somehow no one remembers, I’ll never forget how you treated me like shit.”</p><p data-characters=72 data-current-count=72 data-injectable=false>Cromwell also shared a message she got from Allin’s ex Gigi Dolin.</p><p>“You should really delete that tweet. I know you didn’t name names, however it’s not hard to figure out who you are referring to. Let me get personal here, I WAS sexually assaulted when I was younger. I can not stomach the thought of being in the same room as that person let alone attempting to befriend their wife as you did with me. There’s much more context than you are letting on and it’s not right to potentially bury someone with lack of context and information just to gain sympathy for yourself or relevancy. It may have been a bad relationship but there is no room for you to make statements considering it to be ‘rape’.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p data-characters=133 data-current-count=133 data-injectable=false>If you know someone suffering from sexual violence, contact&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RAINN</a>&nbsp;or the National Sexual Abuse Telephone Hotline at 1-800-656-4673.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpbyzwNJorqudo6m5qrrGZqqtmaJisLC%2BwGahmpyVqHqlscueq56cXZmus67YZpilpJmjerXDxJ6rZp%2BfmsBuwsirmKVn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
