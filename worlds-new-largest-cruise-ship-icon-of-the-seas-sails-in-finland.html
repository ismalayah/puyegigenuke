Are we ever going to need a bigger boat? The world has a new largest cruise ship, and her name is Icon of the Seas.
The Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines vessel was sailed for the first time in inaugural sea trials, close to the Meyer Turku Shipyard in Finland, where she was built."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

At the prow an impressive 25-metre-tall glass structure - the ‘Aquadome’ - containing the tallest ‘waterfall at sea’. As possibly the only waterfall at sea, that didn’t stop them from reaching for the stars.</p><p>The ship is so large the builders refer to each section of the Icon as “neighbourhoods”, of which there are eight. This includes ‘Central Park’ - a landscaped, green space in the central cavity of the ship - <a href=#>furthering comparisons to a city at sea</a>. Throughout these districts are a choice of 40 different diners and restaurants.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/Tm597N1sBiIrW6MAMTMSAUUBS4g=/16x9/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/JHJ33CM5UBCQ5DRGJLMAJSMIAM.jfif"><p>She is around five times the size of the Titanic.

Royal Caribbean says these were the preliminary tests with a second set of sea trials scheduled that “will push Icon to its limits later this year”.</p><p>The Icon will be joined by a sister ship Utopia of the Seas, which is scheduled to go into service later next year. However, at a projected 236,860 Gross Tons for the second Oasis-class ship, the Icon still clinches the record as the world’s largest cruise ship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmraqRq7Kte9aoqaWco2K7psOMpZirn5WowW6v0a6grJ1dqLWqvIyimqimXaSzbsDHnmSsnZGoerStyKWqZqGeYrOqusuapZ1ndICSjqWkjH%2BNjnSLpY%2BZlm2Gb4hkepZ0nLBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
