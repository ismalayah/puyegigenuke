During his first attempt to revive IG-11, the Droid defaulted to its original programming from season one and tried to kill Grogu. Mando and his friends had to make the difficult choice to terminate the droid before anyone could get hurt. One of Greef Karga’s droids managed to stop IG-11 by dropping a bust of Karga on IG’s head, which Mando commented on, saying, “That’s using your head.”</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>What The Mandalorian has done to differentiate Pascal’s popular dad roles was remind us that one of them is a pun-master. If you recall, Joel in The Last of Us showed that he isn’t fond of wordplay as seen in episode four when he failed to laugh at Ellie’s puns from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“No Pun Intended, Volume Too.”</a> In fact, he once beat Ellie to the punchline while the two were camping in a forest before they arrived in Kansas City.</p><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=188 data-injectable=false>While it’s not a lot and is just one piece of dialogue, it just comes to show that despite both of them being protectors, The Mandalorian is much more “pun” to be around.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yxscOrpmaokaiworjSZqGonZxiuqqzx61kp6ekYrmqt8Rmp66mo2KvtsCMnaCnZZSfrrO1zWaqrqqVYrGwsdJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
