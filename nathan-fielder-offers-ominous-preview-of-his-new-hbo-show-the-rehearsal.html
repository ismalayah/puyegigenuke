The 30-minute-per-episode comedy series is “set in a world where nothing seems to ever work out as you had hoped,” with Fielder giving “people the opportunity to rehearse for their own lives,” according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a>.</p><p data-characters=494 data-current-count=494 data-injectable=true>The idea of performing one’s own day-to-day life was a theme of some episodes of Nathan For You, such as one in which Fielder disguised himself as a character whose life was in a rut in order to perform a tight-rope walk in character to catapult him into instant fame. Another episode featured Fielder orchestrating a meticulously recreated play, complete with actors playing the part of real-world people, based on a video recording of the aimless and candid socializing of bar patrons.</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>The Rehearsal does not yet have a set release date for HBO, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>, where it’s currently listed as “in development.” But if Fielder’s tweet is to be believed, it should be arriving on the premium cable network and its streaming service, HBO Max, “soon.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e82aq6GZnmKzqrHLnZyrZZ%2Bbs6a%2B0mampqGepMK0ec%2BrnK%2Bhlax6sLKMoaCsZZ6axG60wahkrKCfrHq1tMRmqZ6glZa%2FtK3LaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
