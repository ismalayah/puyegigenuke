And, with the recent surge in interest regarding both murder mysteries and makeup tutorials, YouTuber <strong>Bailey Sarian</strong> has found the ultimate viral formula. Her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube page</a> combines these pop culture obsessions to perfection, via several popular series.</p><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=378 data-injectable=false>The first of these, titled “Murder, Mystery, and Makeup,” sees Sarian plop herself down in front of viewers for between 35 and 50-some minutes. During her time on-screen, the young streamer fills viewers in on a fresh, weekly true crime story while she applies flawless makeup. Uploads to the series, which are posted on Mondays, typically get between 3 and 5 million views.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=678 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>Another series posted to her YouTube channel, titled “Dark Mysteries,” is similarly popular. While its uploads often have lower view counts, an upload to the “Dark Mysteries” series typically gets a minimum view count in the high hundreds of thousands.</p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=545 data-injectable=true>Between all of her videos, Sarian’s 8-year-old YouTube page has earned more than 577 million views. The channel has upwards of 5.63 million subscribers, many of whom flock to Sarian’s page to enjoy her charming personality, excellent makeup techniques, and intriguing topics.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>Sarian’s loyal fanbase also contributes to her income through views on her YouTube page. The page attracts somewhere around 656,000 daily views, which pay off in the form of ad revenue. Through this form of revenue alone, Sarian earns an estimated $78.76 each month, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Net Worth Spot</a>. This puts her average annual earnings near $1.20 million.</p><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=760 data-injectable=true>This estimation fails to account for numerous other potential forms of revenue, however, including sponsorships, donations, and side jobs. Considering that Sarian has an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">online store</a>, through which she sells attire aimed at fans of her “Dark History” series, the number is almost certainly closer to the high-end estimate, which puts Sarian’s yearly earnings at more than $2.13 million a year.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=275 data-injectable=false>As for her overall net worth, <strong>Sarian</strong> looks to be worth at least $4.73 million, again based on estimations from Net Worth Spot. Thanks to her outside revenue sources, however, it’s likely that her actual net worth is inching closer to the high-end mark of $6.62 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeppMK1wcGeZqGnp2K6tq%2FHZpuonaNir6K1y56wZquRp7aiuoymmKSdXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
