Fox’s Marty McFly to time travel in Back to the Future. Across all three installments, the leading characters use a specially made version of a DeLorean automobile to crisscross between generations, with the sound of the car company proving all too familiar to a certain meme-maker.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Who did this…? 💫⚡️ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/r5rX2OaKqO</a></p>— Christopher Lloyd (@DocBrownLloyd) <a href=#>April 10, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=462 data-current-count=762 data-injectable=true>Presumably keen to credit the creator, Lloyd eagerly accompanied the meme with the caption: “Who did this…”. Replying fans proved equally impressed, with many creating their own memes which likewise connected the two blockbuster franchises.
