Why? Well, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">you can draw your own conclusions on that one</a>, but suffice to say it’s most definitely better left unexplained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/love-scenes-1-e1686986011148.jpg><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>There are actually a couple of recognizable names in the cast, though, with ex-Bond Girl Britt Ekland and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Adam West’s Catwoman Julie Newmar among them</a>, but that still isn’t enough justification as to why a saucy tale that was released almost 40 years ago has suddenly become must-see for a multitude of paying customers. Of course, it’s best not to think about it too much, otherwise you could end up being haunted by the rationale.</p><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>Not that anyone cares, but the storyline does attempt to put an artful twist on its subject matter, with a renowned actress taking on a risque role in a new film that’s being directed by her absent husband. However, she ends up going a little too method by indulging in an extramarital affair with her co-star, throwing both her marriage and the production onto the rocks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonaiqXaeyor%2FOp6pmmpWpwaa%2BjKWcn6xdqrumxM%2BlmKKmlZl6onmTaWSynZGnerC4w2aqpKGeYrOttcKkZKaZm5rAbq7Enamop51isrqx0maYrWWknbJuv9OrnJqlmaO0bsDOqWRqaF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
