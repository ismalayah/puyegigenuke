Recommended Videos Jake and Logan Paul entered broad public consciousness as problematic figures, after Logan’s infamous “Suicide Forest” video went starkly viral back in 2017, and they’ve never really left those roots behind. Logan continues to stir up drama and internet celebrity beefs via his podcast, “Impaulsive,” even as his younger brother works to establish himself as a legitimate pro boxer. His record speaks for itself, but Jake Paul‘s tendency toward drama continues to get him in hot water, even as he rests easy on six wins and zero losses as the boxing world’s “Problem Child."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Molly-Mae Hague recently updated her followers with the announcement of she and Fury’s first child, via a charming post of the happy family on Jan. 29. The post shows the trio in a hospital room, presumably just following the birth of their newest member. The announcement is simply captioned with the baby’s birth date — 23/01/23 — and a white heart, but its simple heartwarming nature wasn’t enough to drive Paul away.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Molly-Mae Hague (@mollymae)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>Paul chose exactly the wrong moment to hype he and Fury’s fight, by posting a comment on the couple’s birth announcement. He added a note, amongst an array of well-wishes and congratulations, claiming that the infant was born “just in time to watch your dad get knocked out.”</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false>Paul’s deeply inappropriate timing quickly sparked backlash, prompting commenters to drag the 26-year-old. Conversation below a screenshot of the Instagram comment —shared by TalkSPORT.com’s Michael Benson — tears into Paul for his insensitivity, and predict an embarrassing loss to Fury.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Not even funny, dude is going to far going after his wife and kids.</p>— Leo Lira Anderson (@peapeapoopoop) <a href=#>January 30, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>There’s lacking class & then there’s this…..</p>— Silverfang2021 – Official.

His decision to sour a birth announcement with smack talk is broadly considered tasteless, and few people are willing to give the YouTuber a pass.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=false>Given Paul’s reputation, the backlash likely won’t register much, but hopefully it will prevent similarly-timed faux pas in the future. Known for his smack talk in the lead up to a fight, Paul was clearly just sticking to his brand, but there’s a time and a place.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S3orfEZqearZyoeq2t056qrWWalq9urdNmq6ilna56p8HRsmShmaNiwamxjLCfqKSVYravwMSrpZ6sXaTCtb7AoJydZZGoeqJ5y6KlnmWZqHqkvs6sqp6cXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
