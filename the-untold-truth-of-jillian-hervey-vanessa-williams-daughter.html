"It all comes down to people, and if you don't have the right people — even if they have all the clout and connections — you just continue to battle different things and it detracts from the music, at least in our life."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWthaYRxe9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5yaKjpaGRo3qpsdGvnLJlppa7pr%2FSmmSwoZyhtqK50mabmq2XncGmvo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
