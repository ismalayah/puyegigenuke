The Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office declared Shalom Peters, 37, deceased at the scene of the collision. In the 9300 block of Oriole Avenue, Peters lived. The Park Ridge police department and the North Regional Major Crimes Task Force (NORTAF) Major Crash Assistance Team needed access to the area of Oakton Street between Greenwood and Cumberland during Tuesday’s morning rush hour in order to conduct an investigation into a crash that was reported at 2:38 a.m.</p><p>The accident, which occurred in the 1000 block of Oakton just west of the border with Niles, resulted in the vehicle coming to rest against a residence at the corner of Clifton Avenue and Oakton. According to the Park Ridge police, only one vehicle was involved in the collision. According to the police, it was anticipated that the route would stay closed for a number of hours.</p><p>There did not appear to be any visible damage to the house, but a nearby utility pole was swaying and appeared to have been destroyed. A sizable contingent of ComEd team members waited while the police were re-creating the scenario.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigkarAorrEsGWcp51ju6h70qGYpaedYr2mwMSrqmankp7Btq3RsmSnnaeoeq670a2mp2WXp7y3sYymmKdlm565rbHDZqCnZZFisKK%2BjJqanKGUmru1ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
