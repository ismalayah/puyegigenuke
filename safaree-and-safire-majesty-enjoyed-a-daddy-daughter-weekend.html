The youngster was recently filmed while enjoying quality time with her dad. Safire followed directly behind her father to the degree of using profanity.</p><p>In the video clip shared by Safaree, Safire is very talkative. <a href=#>The youngster</a> is not as excited about her father promoting his cooking skills and even tells him not to try out his culinary creation. Safaree celebrates his cooking abilities before saying, “Bumboclaat.” Safire repeats the word and her father quickly says, “Don’t say that.”</p><p>In Jamaica, individuals use “bumboclaat” to express disgust at a person, place, or thing. Some even equate the term to menstrual pads or toilet paper. Others view the word as vulgarity that is only used in extreme cases.</p><p>Dozens commented on Safire Majesty’s ability to clearly pronounce the word after her father in the video clip. “She said what she said,” one social media follower exclaimed. “That was the only word that came out clear,” another fan shared.</p><p>Safire Majesty and <a href=#>her younger brother</a>, Legend Samuels, are enjoying their best lives with their mom and dad. It was just a few weeks ago that the kids interrupted their father’s grooming session. Safire and Legend were captured while climbing on their father and standing in front of the mirror as Safaree got his hair cut. “Can’t do nothing in peace,” Safaree mused.</p><p>Some commented on Safaree’s alleged status as a “part-time dad” to scrutinize his comment. Others celebrated the syar dad’s <a href=#>efforts to co-parent</a> with his ex-wife. “That’s what brings the joy,” one fan said. “Love seeing it,” the supporter added. “Keep being a great dad to your seeds,” another social media follower encouraged Safaree.</p><p>Safire Majesty made Safaree a father for the first time in February 2020. Legend was born on June 28, 2021.</p><p>Photo: Safaree/Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kWtmamhfZn1wv8CfmKudlWKur7CMrJifoaKaeq6tyZ6qrbFdmruru9iem2aZXZmupbDYZpuarZedwaa%2BjLCcnqOVo7Fw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
