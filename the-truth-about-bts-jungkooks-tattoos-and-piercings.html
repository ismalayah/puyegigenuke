In addition to having the word "ARMY" on his knuckles, eagle-eyed fans also spotted a heart, a crown, and the letter "J." At the time, some&nbsp;<a href=#>speculated</a> that the tattoos might be temporary or just stage makeup. However, since the ink has continued to pop up in photos and live appearances, it all seems pretty permanent.</p><p>After September 2019, Jungkook was spotted with several more tattoos on his arm, according to a report on <a href=#>All K-Pop</a>. The ink included a skeleton hand making the sign language symbol for "I love you," which is also used to mean "rock on." He also sported the Nirvana lyric "Rather be dead than cool" from the song "Stay Away."&nbsp;</p><p>It's been hard for fans to figure out exactly what all of the tattoos look like since Jungkook usually wears long sleeves, and his team censors the tattoos in photos, <a href=#>Korea Boo</a> reports. The boy band member has even <a href=#>worn patches</a> to cover up his hand tattoos. According to <a href=#>Jazmine Media</a>, fans finally got a definite look at the tattoos in episode 5 of BTS' behind-the-scenes series "Bon Voyage 4." Jungkook wore short sleeves and his tats were on full display — but the photo still isn't very clear.&nbsp;</p><p>While it's a bit difficult to confirm all of Jungkook's tattoos, his piercings are a lot easier to spot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmanBpZoN5e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2XwbR5ya6loKOfpLi0edOaq62nn6h6orrDZqeinaKYtq%2Bz0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
