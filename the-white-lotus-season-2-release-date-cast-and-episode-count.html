In real life, this would constitute an unmitigated public relations nightmare, so it will remain to be seen whether this will be the second and final season,or if series creator, writer, and producer Mike White has some more tricks up his sleeve. (In the opinion of this writer, Mike White always has more tricks up his sleeve.)</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=95 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>With season two of The White Lotus rapidly approaching, here’s everything we know so far.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What is the release date for The White Lotus season two, and how many episodes are there?</h2><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=869 data-injectable=true>Season two of The White Lotus will premiere on HBO on Oct. 30, and will also be available to stream on HBO Max with new episodes released weekly, every Sunday night through Dec. 11.

In the events that have transpired since the first season, Tanya has since married Greg and now sports the newly hyphenated last name, McQuoid-Hunt.</p><p data-characters=513 data-current-count=513 data-injectable=true>The second season also features a roster of familiar faces and newcomers. Aubrey Plaza stars as Harper Spiller, a woman on vacation with her husband, Ethan (Will Sharpe), who has just sold his company for a large sum of money. The couple, much to Harper’s obvious dismay, have been invited on the trip by Ethan’s rich new friends, Cameron and Daphne Babcock (Theo James and Meghann Fahy), though, it does not seem as though there is any love lost from either parties vying for Ethan’s attention.</p><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=272 data-injectable=false>Veteran character actor F. Murray Abraham (Mythic Quest, Moon Knight) stars as Bert Di Grasso, a womanizing octogenarian on vacation with his equally womanizing son (Michael Imperioli,&nbsp;The Sopranos) and grandson, Albie Di Grasso (Adam DiMarco), a recent college graduate.</p><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=683 data-injectable=true>Rounding out the cast is Italian actress and comedian Sabrina Impacciatore as Valentina, the manager of the White Lotus in Sicily; Tom Hollander as Quentin, an English expat traveling with his friends and nephew; Haley Lu Richardson as Portia, Tanya’s young assistant; and Beatrice Grannò and Simona Tabasco as two attractive local girls who will inevitably throw a wrench into things with sex and drugs.</p><p data-characters=103 data-current-count=103 data-injectable=false>If season one was any indication, fans are in for a real treat when The White Lotus returns on Oct. 30.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmrqGhpJp6rbvTrqpmq5WWwLC6jGtkq52cmq60sYydmK2dXZiutMCMmqWdZZWltrS7w55knKelo8Fw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
