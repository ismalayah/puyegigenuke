Rip saw a side of Beth that she didn’t quite recognize in herself, and it was both beautiful and vulnerable to watch her discover it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=568 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=212 data-injectable=false>Fans of Yellowstone are as invested in the relationship between Rip and Beth as they are in finding out the arc of the storyline, maybe because their love is so deeply interwoven into everything within the farm.</p><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>Later in the interview, Rip himself, Cole Hauser, shared his insight into their romance and why people are so invested in the couple’s happily ever after.</p><p>“You know, you can make these romantic stories of love it, you know, first sight and then the sunsets and all these gorgeous things. But the reality is, is that I feel like the audience is — especially here in America, they look at these two and they go, ‘You know what, there’s something I can relate to.’ It might not be everything, but there are little pieces that they take. I think Taylor, you know, he found that heartbeat, and then he saw that Kelly and I enjoy playing that and that we take risks together that we want to push the envelope and that and we love that. You know that’s what we’re here for.”</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=261 data-injectable=false>The risks Beth and Rip take as individuals and as a couple hypnotize audiences who want nothing but the best for the couple; while things certainly took a page out of a fairytale for the pair in the finale of season 4, nothing on the ranch stays quiet for long.</p><p data-characters=47 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>Yellowstone season 5 premieres on November 13.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yssculsGaqlZ65rcWMrJiyq12usq24zrCqraeemsBuvsipZJqmlGKvpsDHZpirnV2ovLa4zJqrnqtf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
