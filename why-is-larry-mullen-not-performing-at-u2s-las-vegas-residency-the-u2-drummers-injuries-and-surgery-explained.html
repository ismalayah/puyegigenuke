Larry Mullen, who has been drumming with the band since their inception, will be abstaining from the 2023 tour. During the Las Vegas shows at The Sphere, Krezip drummer Bram van den Berg will perform in Mullen’s stead.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=715 data-injectable=true>“[Mullen is] very much behind the idea of us going on stage with Bram,” bassist Adam Clayton told RTE Radio 1 (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Irish Mirror</a>). “I’m sure for Larry it’s a difficult moment to know that your band are going on stage and you’re not with them.” Mullen had to drop out of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">U2’s Las Vegas tour</a> because of health issues, which have been cause for concern for some time.</p><h2 id=h-larry-mullen-had-to-step-away-for-his-health data-injectable=false>Larry Mullen had to step away for his health</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/U2-Las-Vegas-residency-.jpg><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>Eventually, decades of non-stop drumming take its toll. Mullen has had such a prolific career with a consistent and popular band that — while he has kept many of the details to himself — has admitted needing to take some time to himself to recover from wear and tear.</p><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>Mullen recently went into surgery for his injuries and still recorded U2’s newest single, “Atomic City.” According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NME</a>, the band recalled that the drummer was in top form for the recording session. However, he is unable to perform on such an immersive tour. During his interview with The Washington Post’s Geoff Edgers, Mullen confessed that after some time and consideration, he realized how much his lifestyle had impacted him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Another Larry quote: “I have lots of bits falling off, elbows, knees, necks, and so during Covid, when we weren't playing, I got a chance to have a look at some of these things. So there's some damage along the way."</p>— Geoff Edgers (@geoffedgers) <a href=#>November 29, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=484 data-injectable=true>Edgers also quoted Mullen stating he wanted to take the time to recuperate so he could join the band at a later time. This would not be the dissolution of U2, just a temporary setback.</p><p>“So I’d like to take some time, which I will do to get myself healed. And I really enjoy playing and I enjoy the process of playing and being in the company of creative people. I enjoy that. I don’t care if that’s big or small. It’s a bit like the sprout looking for water.”</p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=592 data-injectable=false>As it stands now, Mullen is unable to join the tour, but this has been an amicable decision that will surely result in the entirety of the band reuniting in full at a later date. For now, fans are enjoying the Las Vegas experience as U2 puts on a fully visual show of a lifetime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46wn7Jlmah6ra3Rq7BmpaWhuaa6jKemrWWgmr%2Bnu9GmoKefXZbBbsGRrGSlmaNiw6azwKxkq52jnrGmusKyZK2glWLCc3nDq6ympZWnwG61zaOsq6GVqHqiusNmqq6ql5q%2FunnEsaelmZmjsqV7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
