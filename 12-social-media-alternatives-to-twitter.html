However, unlike Twitter, anyone can host their own Mastodon server, meaning you can have tiny versions of Twitter focused on specific topics. But don’t worry. You can also see posts on other public servers while also being a member of a different one.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-11-minds data-injectable=false>11.

However, the site is controversial as it uses cryptocurrency. It pays users in MINDS Tokens when they create popular content, and users can spend these tokens to buy account promotions.</p><h3 id=h-10-counter-social data-injectable=false>10.

No Abuse. No Ads. No Fake News. No Foreign Influence Ops,” Counter Social is a Twitter-like platform with many unique features, including groups, self-destructing posts, and the ability to listen to certain radio stations.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-9-plurk data-injectable=false>9.

These messages are shown on other users’ timelines. Fascinatingly, Plurk timelines scroll horizontally, not vertically, making them literal timelines. Plurk also has a massive international user base, especially in Asia, so for those who can speak one of the languages common in that region, Plurk is even better.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-8-aether data-injectable=false>8.

But it has a few things that make it stand out from the pack. First, people can make their own communities, making micro social media networks for a specific topic. Also, messages vanish after six months if not saved, making Aether perfect for people who value their privacy. Thirdly, each community is democratically controlled, allowing users to vote for their mods and impeach those they disagree with, allowing users to control their experience more than on other platforms.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-7-amino data-injectable=false>7.

However, it is aimed at teens, so keep that in mind. Amino lets users make communities based on their interests. These communities can include posts of many types, including standard ones like pictures and videos to more unique ones like polls and quizzes. And, in one really cool touch, it has a built-in voice chat and a system that allows users to watch videos together.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-6-hive-social data-injectable=false>6.

While it is still in the early stages, the developers plan to add more in the future, including the ability to accept tips and subscriptions.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-4-micro-blog data-injectable=false>4.

It doesn’t have ads. Plus, the site has strict moderation standards, meaning that the spam and abuse seen on other platforms aren’t seen here. Plus, it doesn’t use algorithms and relies instead on content curation to deliver users new content.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=94 data-current-count=94 data-injectable=false>The only downside is that you will need to pay a monthly fee to unlock all the features.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-3-tiktok data-injectable=false>3.

The site is divided into subreddits, small communities dedicated to a single topic. Due to Reddit’s age and vast user base, there is a subreddit for nearly everything, from the obvious to the highly obscure, making it great for people with specific interests.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=261 data-injectable=false>While not a social network in the modern sense, you can post directly to your profile. Plus, Reddit lets you follow users, allowing you to get a pseudo-Twitter experience.
