Marcille recalled a particularly unexpected moment of blunt criticism that occurred after she won the show in 2004. She recounted the incident on the most recent episode of her podcast, “The Undressing Room” with Lore’l and Dominique Da Diva.
“When I won Top Model, the first thing I was told outside of Tyra [Banks’] ‘Congratulations,’ Janice Dickinson said, ‘Now you can take your money and get your nose fixed,’” she said."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I didn’t know there was anything wrong with it.”</p><p>However, Marcille was clear about not falling into the shallow way of thinking of the “naysayers” and coming to terms with the fact that that people will always have opinions.</p><p>“This is the same nose, same big lips, same everything,” she said. “But my point is, people always have something to say, especially when you’re in the light. There’s always something that someone’s going to have to say about you. The question is, at what point do you stop listening to the world and start listening to yourself?”</p><p>Despite the awkward encounter with Dickinson, Marcille has remained positive about her experience on the reality TV program, and even chastised former contestant Winnie Harlow, who claimed that the show did little to help her career.</p><p>During a December 2018 appearance on an episode of “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen</a>” the former “Real Housewives of Atlanta” star voiced her disapproval about Harlow’s complaints.</p><p>“You know what, it amazes me that people get opportunities and they totally forget who gave them those opportunities. Winnie Harlow is a beautiful girl. Let’s be clear. We know her because of ‘Top Model,’” Marcille said.</p><p>“The world knows her, Drake knows her, Wiz Khalifa knows her because of ‘Top Model,’” she said. “To diss Tyra, who gave everyone this huge platform, I think it’s really wack.”</p><p>Marcille has remained close with “America’s Next Top Model” mastermind Banks and has expressed her appreciation for the supermodel’s guidance. She made a rare public appearance with the “Dancing with the Stars” host on a Feb. 23 episode of “WWHL,” during which Marcille revealed she was grateful to Banks for sharing some valuable advice with her the night she won “America’s Next Top Model.”</p><p>“You said, you know, ‘You’re relatable, you’re what girls at home are. And don’t lose that, because that’s what’s sellable and that’s what keeps you connected.’ And I’ve always carried that,” she said.</p><p>The next day, Marcille posted an effusive Instagram <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">message</a> praising Banks for her work and thanking her for her mentorship:</p><p>“Words can’t express how special last night was… sharing the stage with my mentor, my motivation, my Muva! @tyrabanks Looking back 16 years ago all I can say is thank you. Thank you for what you’ve done for me, hundreds of others and the entire industry. You have redefined what we know as beauty and created inclusion for us and our types of beauty!! Can’t wait to go to #modelland 🌻”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9ye49sZmpoX5rDonnMmqmcoZyhsm6ty6WcoJ2jYsGptdJmmKesnWK3trDGnmStp5yZeqmx0WarqGWWnsVutMSrZKeno5p6orLTnqlmr5mju6q6xmaaspucmnp0echmm6Kcnql6rLrOsGSmsV2jvLSxjLCYrGWSp7yssY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
