They&nbsp;announced their divorce in 2000.</p><p>In 1994, her family relocated to Scituate, Massachusetts, where she attended public schools. As per&nbsp;newyorker.com, her mother, Janet, a retired nurse, and her father, Peter, didn’t have a healthy marriage.</p><p>It led them to announce their divorce in 2000, but the judicial proceedings took three years. Throughout that period, Konkle’s father, Peter, refuses to leave the family home. The home was divided between two opposing territories, with Konkle frequently acting as a mediator.</p><p>Even though Peter and Janet did not have a warm relationship, they supported one another while co-parenting Anna. They fulfilled their parenting responsibilities by giving their daughter a good education and assisting her in choosing a career she was always interested.</p><p>Anna also&nbsp;shared&nbsp;a few pictures that captured moments with her mother on Instagram. She posted a picture with her mother in 2015, wishing everyone a happy day after Thanksgiving.</p><p>Later in 2018, she&nbsp;uploaded&nbsp;an image of herself as a child with her mother wearing weird makeup. She captioned the picture, “Just a normal throwback picture of my mom and me. Happy nightmares.”</p><p>Anna, unfortunately, had to deal with a devastating loss in 2019 when her father, Peter, passed away from lung cancer. A few months after his passing, the actress&nbsp;posted&nbsp;a lengthy, heartwarming statement on her Instagram account.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=inside-her-married-life></span>Inside Her Married Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Anna Konkle boyfriend Alex Anfanger is an actor and producer.
