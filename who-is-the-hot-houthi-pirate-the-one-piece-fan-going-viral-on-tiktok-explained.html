Not long after, he was interviewed on Twitch by none other than Hasan – <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">everyone’s favorite political streamer with the highest amount of haters possible</a> – becoming the hot topic for the day.</p><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=612 data-injectable=true>At this point, you’re probably wondering exactly what he has to do with One Piece — aside from all the pirate analogies in his new online alias, that is. And that’s exactly what I’m here to clarify.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-the-hot-houthi-pirate-on-tiktok data-injectable=false>Who is the Hot Houthi Pirate on Tiktok?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>yemeni pirates positing casual tiktok’s while the entire western imperial core are having a meltdown about their blockade on their ships is the funniest shit of 2024, surely. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/72EvlHZeMs</a></p>— FOLLOW RASHID🔻ميكا ☭ (@comrademika) <a href=#>January 15, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=631 data-injectable=true>The now-known “hot Houthi Pirate” on TikTok is a Yemeni man who allegedly is part of the Houthi movement — a military organization that emerged in Yemen in the 1990s. Through his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> accounts, the man has often shared videos and images of his endeavors in the Red Sea, amidst a high-tension conflict.</p><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>While this may not seem interesting enough to warrant such newfound attention for the man, it all changed on January 17 when he uploaded a video displaying the Yemeni flag, and the algorithm did its thing. The comments were immediately and understandably flooded with compliments, as more and more people became absolutely enthralled by this man’s good looks.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=665 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>“Did you see the thirst trap from the Yemeni pirate” is not a thing I ever thought I would say</p>— naomi (@lachancenaomi27) <a href=#>January 16, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true>After many people noticed he was often aboard sea vessels, he fittingly earned the title of “Hot Houthi Pirate.” Comments such as, “I don’t understand what you’re saying, but you’re really handsome, and I support all your endeavors,” flooded the comment section. Another user exclaimed, “You’re so hot!! Your actions make you hotter!! So brave!! A real man.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How is the Hot Houthin Pirate connected to One Piece?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>HE'S A ONE PIECE FAN <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/EtChsC32Ok</a></p>— HasPause (@HasPause) <a href=#>January 16, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=658 data-injectable=true>Apart from the evident connection between these two ‘pirates’, it turns out that the Houthi man is a devoted One Piece fan. During Hasan’s interview on Twitch, the streamer broached the topic of One Piece, asking if the man was familiar with the anime, particularly given <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the striking parallels between the Houthi pirate and the Straw Hats</a>.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>As a translator facilitated the conversation, relaying the question to the man, he promptly affirmed that he had been watching One Piece since his childhood. Hasan, in an excited response, drew a comparison between the actions of the Houthis and how that would be exactly what “Luffy would do.”</p><p lang=zxx dir=ltr><a href=#>https://t.co/Dk4PWRAavu</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/QBON3Wvrew</a></p>— Psychedelic Socialist (@Acid_Communist) <a href=#>January 17, 2024</a><p data-characters=457 data-current-count=764 data-injectable=true>Throughout the One Piece series, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pirates are often branded as the scourge of the seas</a>, to be eradicated at any cost. In light of this, Hasan aptly drew a parallel between the Straw Hats, who are some of the World Government’s biggest opponents, and the Houthis, who were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recently designated as a terror group by the U.S</a>. Recently, the Houthis conducted an attack on Western ships after the U.S . and the U.K. launched a series of airstrikes on Yemen.</p><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=false>This comparison might seem absurd for many people watching these events happen in real-time, however, One Piece <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">is a highly political forward anime and manga</a>, often deriving its storylines from real-life events — past and present. It doesn’t come as entirely surprising that Hasan, who is a known One Piece fan, would quickly conduct a direct comparison between the Houthis and the Straw Hats.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn6hlmah6tbTEZp%2BorF2dvLbAx6JkqaGilsGmedOhnGannpp6sbXEnJxmnpGjeqi7yKeeZq6Zp66tec6nZK2hm6m8rHnEsaelmZmjsqV7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
