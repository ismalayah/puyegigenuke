In 2016, Leibel, a Canadian graphic novelist who hoped to make it in Hollywood, brutally tortured and killed his fiancée and mother of his child, Iana Kasian.</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=676 data-injectable=true>According to the <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a>, Blake Leibel is the son of Lorne Leibel, a Canadian Olympic sailor and wealthy construction industry executive. In 2004, Leibel moved to Los Angeles, where he lived on his parents’ money, and tried to break into Hollywood. While in L.A., Liebel met Kasian, a Ukrainian woman. In 2014, Kasian moved to the U.S. to work as an interpreter.</p><h2 id=h-iana-kasian-was-tortured-and-killed data-injectable=false>Iana Kasian was tortured and killed</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>via Investigation Discovery/YouTube</figure><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=629 data-injectable=true>It’s unclear what caused Leibel to snap, but in 2016, Kasian’s mother, Olga Kasian, who had moved to Los Angeles from Ukraine to be near her daughter and granddaughter, took Leibel and Iana’s child so the couple could work on their relationship. It’s here where Leibel’s story grows truly horrific.</p><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>While Olga cared for her granddaughter, Leibel inexplicably trapped Iana in their West Hollywood apartment. He then maliciously tortured and killed her, dismembering her while she was still alive. Leibel was jealous of his newborn child, and how Iana died was similar to something that happened in Leibel’s 2010 graphic novel, Syndrome.</p><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=648 data-injectable=true>At Leibel’s trial, Superior Court Judge Mark E. Windham called the Leibel case “ … unusual only in its savagery” and added that Leibel’s acts showed “inconceivable cruelty” (via the LA Times). Iana’s official cause of death was ruled exsanguination or severe blood loss.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Leibel was sentenced to life in prison</h2><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a>, in 2018, Blake Leibel was found guilty of first-degree murder, aggravated mayhem, and torture and sentenced to life in prison with no chance for parole. He was also ordered to pay Iana Kasian’s family millions. As of 2024, Leibel served that sentence at the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">California Correctional Institution</a> in Tehachapi, near Bakersfield.</p><p data-characters=85 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true>Referring to the Liebel case, Deputy District Attorney Beth Silverman said in court,</p><p>“This was depravity. Ms. Kasian died a slow and painful death … [Liebel] threw away pieces of his fiancée like she was trash, the mother of his newborn baby … [Iana’s] daughter will never know her, and that’s because of the unconscionable acts you heard about during this trial.”</p>via Daily Mail<p data-characters=120 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=false>Death by Fame from Investigation Discovery is available to stream Jan. 22, 2024, on Max, Apple TV, and other platforms.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX5myosDHZpmyZZaWuqZ51qGcq51dnsBursuaop5lnJq2o7HLZqWor18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
